# AB_testing_simulation

This project has two files

i) the pdf files is a sort of blog explaining by in certain cases especially when sample size is small, expected utility/bayesian approach is better than frequentist approach (statistical significance) to learn from experiments and take the best decision given the results of the experiment.

ii) The .ipynb is the notebook containing the code of the simulation that illustrates that expected utlity/bayesian approach is better when our goal is to pick the better option between A/B given the results.
